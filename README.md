# Two Birds One Stone

Project: I want to create a game where there are birds flying across the sky from opposite sides of the screen. The player's goal is to shoot one or both of the objects with a stone shot from a gun at the bottom of the screen, before they collide with one another. The player can move back and forth on the screen using the arrow keys, and can shoot with the spacebar. As the player's score increases, the amount of birds generated multiplies. I plan to create different classes in Qt for all the objects I will create, and use the class QGraphicsPixmapItem to generate graphics. There will be a score displayed on the screen. The game window closes when the player uses all 3 of his/her lives.
