# salazar_final_project

Project: I want to create a game where there are objects flying across the sky from opposite sides of the screen. The player's goal is to shoot one or both of the objects before they collide with one another. The player can move back and forth on the screen using the arrow keys, and can shoot with either the spacebar or the mouse. I plan to create different classes in Qt for all the objects I will create, and use the class QGraphicsPixmapItem to generate graphics. There will be a score displayed on the screen.
